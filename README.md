This app is an educational project based around creating an authentication system from scratch.

The Odin Project curriculum:
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication

The objective is to create an exclusive "clubhouse" where members can write embarrassing posts about non-members.

Inside the "clubhouse," members are able to see who the author of a post is, but outside, they can only see the story.
